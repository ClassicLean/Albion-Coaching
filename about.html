        <h3>My Albion Online Story</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          I started out as a small-scale player, enjoying skirmishes and open-world fights. Over time, I transitioned into 
          instanced PvP such as 2v2, 5v5, 10v10, and 20v20. With years of practice and competitive play, 
          I’ve built a deep understanding of Albion’s PvP systems. I decided to start coaching because I saw a 
          demand for guidance and knew I could help players who struggle with PvP by sharing my experience.

        <h3>My Coaching Philosophy</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          My coaching is centered around the "fix one mistake" approach — focusing on identifying the biggest obstacle 
          holding you back and improving it step by step. This method builds long-term progress while ensuring each session 
          leaves you with actionable improvements. Clients can expect structured feedback, detailed breakdowns of fights, 
          and strategies tailored to their goals.
